Players queue up in a line. They determine how many fruits they want. 
These fruits are displayed randomly as 'AA', 'BB', 'CC' etc
In the list of fruits, there are behives. Displayed as '##'

A player will select a number, and get that many items in the list. If any contain a beehive, they are out of the game.
Last person remaining wins.
