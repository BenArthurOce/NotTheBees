Things to do 24/06/2022:

Determine Winner when game has 1 player left
Replace Fruit display with better displays (Currently 'AA', 'BB'... etc)
Add some kind of AI, using the logic of the "poison number" game
Impliment a input restriction that only allows for 1-2-3 fruits
Beehives are currently put into slot 10, 20, 30 and 40. 
  - We only need 3 Beehives.
  - Should I randomize where the Beehives go?
      Also Considering:
        - Only after a certain number of fruits
        - Not having the beehives too close togeathor


Possible that Fruit(), Behive() and Empty() could be combined as one class?
Should Converyor be its own class?
Should the game display be its own class?
