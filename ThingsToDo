Things to do 24/06/2022:

Determine Winner when game has 1 player left
Replace Fruit display with better displays (Currently 'AA', 'BB'... etc)
Add some kind of AI, using the logic of the "poison number" game
Impliment a input restriction that only allows for 1-2-3 fruits


Possible that Fruit(), Behive() and Empty() could be combined as one class?
Should Converyor be its own class?
Should the game display be its own class?
